# Migrating From Workspace Playlists (aka Plans)

As we get even closer to our goal of implementing Swimm in a manner that is, as much as possible,
aligned with the concept of DAC ([Docs As Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/)), we're
excited to announce two really important things about Swimm Playlists:

 1. Playlists are now saved in your `.swm/` folder in our new `.sw.md` format. We no longer
    need to assemble them from metadata on our side, it's all stored in your documentation!
 
 2. A playlist is now a global thing by default. In previous versions, you needed a special
    kind of playlist to link to Swimm content from different repositories in a workspace; we 
    originally called that type of list a Plan and then later a Workspace Playlist. There's
    no more distinction, one type of playlist can link throughout the workspace.

If you go to any repository in your workspace and click on `+` to make a new playlist, you'll see
that you get the view that you're used to from the workspace / plan type:

Every playlist is now the same, as far as capabilities go.

## What do I need to do?

We're removing the Workspace Playlist object type for compatibility. 

Because Playlists are now tightly interlinked with the documents that they contain, there's no
practical automatic way of migrating from a Workspace Playlist to a standard one. You'll need
to go to any repo, create a new Playlist to replace each existing Workspace Playlist, and just
enter the steps into the new playlist. 

Then, delete the old ones.
