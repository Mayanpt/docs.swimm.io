# Contributing To Swimm Community Projects

We're so glad you're here! If you're interested in getting more involved with
helping others become advocates for up-to-date and comprehensive documentation,
we've got plenty that you can do. 

If you haven't yet done so, please check out our [community page](/community)
and say hello in Slack, where we coordinate our community efforts.

After that, you can do one, or however many you like, of the following things.
All of them help equally, just pick things that seem like something you want
to do.

## Help Spread The Word

Do you blog about your work or hobby experiences? We'd love to read about your 
honest take and experiences with Swimm. We also encourage you to write about the
process that led you to find Swimm.

Our goal is to boost awareness of just how much a lack of documentation can
harm productivity and developer job satisfaction. We want people to use *something* 
first and foremost; the practice needs to be elevated drastically in our industry.

Let us know through any community channel when you publish it, and we might
even be able to share it in our channels. 

## Write A Script, Tool, Tutorial, Or Anything Else Handy. 

If you've done something clever with your CI configs, or developed a script to
automate something related to your Swimm workflow, put it in a repository somewhere
and send us a link to it. We'll include it in our community integrations page and
mention it in the next release notes.

## Translate This Website

Docusaurus has a relatively simple [i18n implementation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/introduction).
The fact that it's also statically-generated reduces a lot of complexity, it's just
maintaining a copy of the [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) source files. 

If you're interested in contributing a translation, please reach out to us at 
`community@swimm.io` and let us know. This site is currently a work-in-progress
with strings continuing to change daily, so it'll be a few more months at least
before it's stable enough to start.

We'll then reach out to you once the time comes.
