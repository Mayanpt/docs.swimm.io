We're very thrilled to launch our new developer documentation and community 
portal using the immensely flexible and feature rich [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) 
to manage all of the content.

Along, with detailed documentation, videos and tutorials, you'll find detailed 
release notes for every Swimm Release, as well as news about our other tools, such
as our [IDE Plugins](/docs/publishing-content/ide-plugins) or [Github App](/docs/continuous-integration/github-app).

:::tip You can pull RSS or Atom feeds to stay up-to-date:

Swimm generally releases at the beginning of every week, so you can expect updates
to be pretty low volume. There will also be a note if new tutorials are added, or
any other features that impact the functionality of this site. Major new features
and announcements can be found on [our main blog](https://swimm.io/blog/).

Please consider checking our our [community info](/community) and consider joining
our <SwimmLink target="slack" />, or dropping in during our next <SwimmLink target="officeHours" />.

Thanks for your interest in Swimm!
