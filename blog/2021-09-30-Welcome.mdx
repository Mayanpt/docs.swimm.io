We're very thrilled to launch our new developer documentation and community 
portal using the immensely flexible and feature rich [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) 
to manage all of the content.

Along, with detailed documentation, videos and tutorials, you'll find detailed 
(machine-generated) release notes for every major and minor version of Swimm, 
as well as notifications of new things to explore here. 

:::tip You can pull RSS or Atom feeds to stay up-to-date:

<Tabs
    defaultValue="rss"
    values={[
        {label: 'RSS', value: 'rss'},
        {label: 'Atom', value: 'atom'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="rss">
        <code>{url}/blog/rss.xml</code>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="atom">
        <code>{url}/blog/atom.xml</code>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Swimm generally releases at the beginning of every week, so you can expect updates
to be pretty low volume. There will also be a note if new tutorials are added, or
any other features that impact the functionality of this site. Major new features
and announcements can be found on [our main company blog](https://swimm.io/blog/).

Thanks for being awesome, being here, and being interested in Swimm!
