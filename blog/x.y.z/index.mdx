This is an exmple of automated relase notes. Each entry is a subdirectory and
contains a single `index.mdx` file from a template.

This will just be a bulleted list that is generated from ClickUp and presented
for anyone wanting to see all the details of any tiny bugfix or optimization
that just isn't worth mentioning in the main blog post on the main site. 

 - Fixed annoying bug in login screen
 - Updated all of the things everywhere
 - Algorithm is now faster than light

Notes from previous releases will be auto-generated prior to launch.
