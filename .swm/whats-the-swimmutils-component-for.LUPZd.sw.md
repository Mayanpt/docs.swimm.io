The `ðŸ“„ src/components/SwimmUtils.js` component is a utility component that makes access to Swimm's local configuration & versioning ( `ðŸ“„ swimm.config.js` `ðŸ“„ releases.config.json` ) extremely convenient. It's also handy for link shortcuts, writing release notes, and even rendering emoji, and even emoji Macros!

Put simply, it's a toolbox to make content creation more fun and easier.

I'll have it documented better soon, it's still growing as I find things it needs to do.
