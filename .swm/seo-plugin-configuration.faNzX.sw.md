===========================

We have a sitemap generator as well as a gtags generator built in, and both run periodically, triggered by a visitor poking a function that sees enough time has passed to regenerate the files on the fly. We also have Google Analytics configured to run on this site.

<br/>

Here we define how often the site map regenerates itself (it will always be rebuilt in a production build)
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ docusaurus.config.js
```javascript
â¬œ 34             theme: {
â¬œ 35               customCss: require.resolve('./src/css/custom.css'),
â¬œ 36             },
ðŸŸ© 37             sitemap: {
ðŸŸ© 38               changefreq: 'weekly',
ðŸŸ© 39               priority: 0.5,
ðŸŸ© 40             },
â¬œ 41           }),
â¬œ 42         ],
â¬œ 43       ],
```

<br/>

And here's where we insert our GA identifier (this is not secret at all)
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ docusaurus.config.js
```javascript
â¬œ 242            darkTheme: darkCodeTheme,
â¬œ 243          },
â¬œ 244          /*
ðŸŸ© 245          googleAnalytics: {
ðŸŸ© 246            trackingID: 'XX-XXXXXXXXX-X',
ðŸŸ© 247            anonymizeIP: true,
ðŸŸ© 248          },
ðŸŸ© 249          */
ðŸŸ© 250          gtag: {
ðŸŸ© 251            trackingID: 'GTM-TJP96GG',
ðŸŸ© 252            anonymizeIP: false,        
ðŸŸ© 253          },
â¬œ 254        }),
â¬œ 255    });
```

<br/>

These are configured to be zero-maintenance, so you shouldn't need to worry about them.
