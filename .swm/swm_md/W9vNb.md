All of the documentation that lives in the side bar can be found in `docs âœ“` . The main landing page for that section is `docs/index.mdx âœ“` , which is what you see if you navigate to `/docs` directly on the site. There's also a nav link to go right to the documentation without first viewing the quick start.

Documents have a special table at the top that determines their slug, title, and sort order for display. Let's take a quick look at what's going on in `docs/authorization âœ“` , starting with `docs/authorization/_category_.json âœ“`

<br/>

The JSON file determines where the _category_ should be displayed (in which order) as well as set the name for the category.

<div style="background: #e5ecff; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px; border-bottom: 1px solid #c1c7d0; border-radius: 4px; color: black">    ðŸ“„ docs/authorization/_category_.json âœ… Up to Date*

   </div>

```json
â¬œ 1      {
ðŸŸ© 2          "label": "Signup & Authorization",
ðŸŸ© 3          "position": 2
â¬œ 4      }
```
<br/>

The markup at the top of the file determines the slug, and the sort order within the category itself. Docusaurus will override anything in the `id âœ“` value here with the contents of the first H1 tag in the document, if it exists.

<div style="background: #e5ecff; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px; border-bottom: 1px solid #c1c7d0; border-radius: 4px; color: black">    ðŸ“„ docs/authorization/index.mdx âœ… Up to Date*

   </div>

```mdx
ðŸŸ© 2      id: Signup & Authorization
ðŸŸ© 3      slug: authorization
ðŸŸ© 4      sidebar_position: 0
â¬œ 5      ---
```

For top-level documents above any of the sections, the sort orders will be used, with the categories always coming last.
