In almost all cases, you should just use `Make` to change the state of your working branch. If you don't have Make installed and don't wish to install it, then follow the instructions in [Building The Site Manually](building-the-site-manually.Rmly2.sw.md).

To understand the Makefile, just run `make help` to see the available targets, and an explanation of what they do. The output is defined in the file itself and explained below this snippet:

<br/>

In fact, it's the default target.

### ðŸ“„ Makefile
```makefile
â¬œ 1      .PHONY: all help production clean distclean dev
â¬œ 2      
ðŸŸ© 3      help:
ðŸŸ© 4      	@echo "Target        | Explanation"
ðŸŸ© 5      	@echo "production    | Run a complete production build from scratch."
ðŸŸ© 6      	@echo "release-notes | Generate or refresh release notes from clickup"
ðŸŸ© 7      	@echo "dev           | alias for npx docusaurus run"
ðŸŸ© 8      	@echo "world         | distclean, production and then dev"
ðŸŸ© 9      	@echo "clean         | remove module cache and build directories"
ðŸŸ© 10     	@echo "distclean     | runs clean, and also removes .docusaurus and lockfiles"
ðŸŸ© 11     	@echo "help          | this help screen (and default if no other argument is given)"
ðŸŸ© 12     
ðŸŸ© 13     all: help
â¬œ 14     
â¬œ 15     production:
â¬œ 16     	@echo "Creating production build"
```

To get up and running locally, just run make `world`[<sup>1</sup>](#1) . To start a development environment just run make `dev`[<sup>2</sup>](#2) . Eventually, the `release-notes`[<sup>3</sup>](#3) target will run another local script that queries Clickup to generate or refresh a list of all changes as structured in `ðŸ“„ blog`

Because Docusaurus V2 is still in beta, there may be _slight_ idiosyncrasies with link and duplicate route checking that don't show up in your local dev environment, however, they will show up when you run a full production build.

So, at the minimum, you should run `make production` at least prior to pushing, and ideally before commits to any changes to the link. structure of the site. This behavior is defined in `ðŸ“„ docusaurus.config.js`

<br/>

We throw `onBrokenLinks`[<sup>4</sup>](#4) because we never want to push a broken link. This means any link defined in the header, footer, or sidebar, as well as any link created by the `@docusaurus/Link` component.
