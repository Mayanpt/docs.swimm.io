There are three kinds of links to keep track of when you're working with our Docusaurus setup:

1.  Auto-generated header and footer links from `ðŸ“„ docusaurus.config.js` as well as the left sidebar, which is generated by a combination of `ðŸ“„ docs/authorization/_category_.json` files in each directory along with slugs contained in the metadata at the top of each entry.
    
2.  Links created by the `@docusaurus/Link` component, which is predominately what's used in any content contained in a file ending with a `.mdx` extension, because this gives us centralized control over link behavior through modifying a single component.
    
3.  Traditional Markdown link syntax, like `[link text](/url/to/target]`, which should be reserved only for files that end in `.md` that contain some kind of markup that the MDX provider can't negotiate, or that we somehow grab on-the-fly.
    

In almost all cases, you should use the `Link` component as shown below:

<br/>

Make sure you import the `Link`[<sup>1</sup>](#1) component directly below the page metadata. You can import other things too, of course.

### ðŸ“„ docs/index.mdx
```mdx
â¬œ 5      ---
â¬œ 6      import HomepageFeatures from '../src/components/HomepageFeatures';
â¬œ 7      import FeedSelector from '../src/components/FeedSelector';
ðŸŸ© 8      import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';
â¬œ 9      
â¬œ 10     # Welcome!
â¬œ 11     
```

<br/>

You can then use `Link`[<sup>2</sup>](#2) to form your links. For internal links (within the doc site) use `to="/path/to/route"`, for external links, instead specify it as `href="https://example.com`. We will eventually be implementing shortcut components that wrap this with additional styles, so it's easy to create an internal / external / big button style link without having to go look up what class it needs.
