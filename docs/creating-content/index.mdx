# Creating Content With Swimm

Swimm is a comprehensive, modern code documentation tool that is built
from many loosely-coupled components. Because Swimm is completely 
language-agnostic, we know that our customers have many different
workflows. 

Swimm's functional unit is called a <Link to="/docs/creating-content/workspaces">
Workspace</Link> and is an object that groups people on a team with the 
repositories that they work on.

Swimm's <Link to="/docs/creating-content/fluid-editor">Fluid Editor</Link>, 
paired with its <Link to="/docs/creating-content/smart-tokens">Smart Tokens</Link> 
and <Link to="/docs/creating-content/snippet-studio">Snippet Studio</Link>
is the foundation for truly modern documentation. Build great 
media-rich docs on scaffolding made out of the code that you're explaining, 
that is designed to <Link href="/docs/publishing-content/autosync">Autosync</Link> 
and be highly resilient to even major refactoring.

<Link to="/docs/quickstart" 
    className="button button--secondary button--lg">Check out the quick start</Link>

Once you've at least skimmed the quickstart, we recommend you start
by thinking of things that would be really common to get someone up
to speed, and begin a document to write about one by starting it 
with enough snippets to teach it.

Then, create a <Link to="/docs/creating-content/playlists">playlist</Link> to tie
those tasks together in order, along with links to your existing README files and
even images or videos. You might also want to think about an offboarding playlist,
to help minimize knowledge leaks. People don't just offboard because they leave a
company, they offboard any time they change teams. In modern microservice 
architecture this can happen very frequently.
