# Swimm Quick Start 

This ten minute video shows you how to sign up, connect your Github account, give Swimm the permissions it needs to work, and create your first Swimm document. Then, we show you how to keep your documentation up-to-date through continuous integration, and how to make your documentation discoverable just-in-time through our IDE plugins. This will give you a great sense of Swimm's functionality and feel, and start your thinking on ways that you can integrate it.
