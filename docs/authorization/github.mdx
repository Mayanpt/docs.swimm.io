# Github Sign In & Authorization

We try to make signing in as frictionless as possible. However, Swimm can't
control the entire experience, so we've put together a short list of things
that are handy to know in advance.

## Making Sure You Use The Correct Account

It is very likely that you'll receive an invitation to join a workspace
to your work email address. But, unless your company has requested that you
create a Github account tied *only* to your work email address, it's extremely
likely that you want to use your *personal* account when signing into Github
upon following the invite link. 

A handy way to tell in advance is to open your Github profile page, which is
found at `https://github.com/your-githuyb-username`. At the bottom-left side
of the page, you'll see a section for Achievements and Organizations:

:::info Example Github Profile Excerpt Showing The Swimm Organization

<img alt="Github Organizations Sample" src={useBaseUrl('/img/github-organizations.png')} />

:::

If you see *your* company logo there it means you're logged in to the correct 
account, and that's the account you should use when you follow the invite link.

## Selecting The Correct Repositories & Permissions

As explained in <Link to="/docs/authorization/permissions">permissions</Link>, Swimm
is going to need access to the organization that owns the repoistories, as well
as access to the individual repositories themselves.

You can manage this access in Github.

## Sometimes Loading Github's Response Takes Time

If you have a lot of repositories associated with your Github account and organization
it can sometimes take 30 - 45 seconds for Github to return a response. Please allow
up to a minute; if there is a timeout, we'll report it and give you a button to
try again. This seldom happens, and if it does, it will only happen when the admin
user initially sets up a workspace.
