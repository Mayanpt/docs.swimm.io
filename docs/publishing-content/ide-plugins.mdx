# Swimm's IDE Plugins

Swimm's IDE plugins allow you to see links to Swimm documentation right from
the code that they document. When you click on a link, your IDE will open a 
new tab with the documentation perfectly rendered from Markdown. You can then
kick off a split window, and read the documentation side-by-side with the 
code you're working on. 

Here's how Swimm documents are advertised within the IDE - take this state
machine transition table as an example:

<img alt="Swimm VSCode Plugin Showing Swimm Unit Link" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ide-plugins_1.png')} />

Links appear *per snippet* that you include in your documentation, so the more
snippets, the better the in-IDE coverage is going to be. Continuing the example,
let's say someone was looking for clues about that state machine in the header:

<img alt="Swimm VSCode Plugin Showing Swimm Unit Link" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ide-plugins_2.png')} />

What's even more special is the ability to read the in-depth doc, right there in
the IDE, by just clicking on one of those unit links:

<img alt="Swimm VSCode Plugin Showing Whole Unit In Tab" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ide-plugins_3.png')} />
