:::warning Content Needs Review Before Launch

The product team is currently figuring out how we deal with the notion / confluence
cases since the CLI tool is no longer a given. This needs to be adjusted to reflect
how it actually gets implemented.

# Third-party Knowledgebases

Swimm's markdown is easily shared to your internal wikis or knowledgebases. If the
back-end supports markdown, you can open your docs right from the `.swm/` directory
and copy/paste it, or write a script to read the files and upload them using 
whatever API the software provides. Most developer-centric platforms have a RESTful
API that allows simple '*Create this if it doesn't exist, update it if it does*' 
functionality.

You can also use any text transformation tool to produce PDFs, styled HTML, or
whatever else you need. In fact, if you come up with something that you think
might help someone else, we hope you'll check out our <Link to="/contribute">
contributor information</Link> so we can share it and give you credit!

## Supported Transformations

Swimm already understands the formats that Notion and Confluence require so that
things are rendered correctly. To take advantage of this, grab the latest version
of our CLI tool like this:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/bin/
src=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/swimmio/SwimmReleases/releases/latest | grep 'browser_download_url.*swimm-cli' | cut -d '"' -f 4) 
wget -O ~/bin/swimm_cli $src
chmod +x ~/bin/swimm_cli
```
This will save the executable to `/home/yourname/bin/` where you can invoke it. The
rest of these examples assume that you will be running them from the root of the 
repository that you want to export or automate:

### Notion

To export your documentation in Notion-friendly format, go to the repository root and
type the following command:

```
~/bin/swimm_cli export -n /tmp
```

Your documentation will be saved to `/tmp`.

### Confluence / HTML 
To export your documentation in Confluence-friendly format, go to the repository root and
type the following command:

```
~/bin/swimm_cli export -c /tmp
```

Your documentation will be saved to `/tmp`.

### Docusaurus

To export your documentation in Docusaurus-friendly format (it includes an index), go to the repository root and
type the following command:

```
~/bin/swimm_cli export -d /tmp
```

Your documentation will be saved to `/tmp`. From that, please <Link href="https://github.com/swimmio/docusaurus-template">
